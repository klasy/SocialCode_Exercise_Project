SocialCode Test Project

First of all I should say that this is just a project created for the only purpose to satisfy the test task from SocialCode.

=====================================================================================
0.Introduction.

The task is:
  Create a Python / Django web application which provides a single api (/analyze-image) which accepts an image file and returns recognized text in the image. For example in the attached image 'cbsnews' would be returned as plain text (or in a json struct). Image recognition quality is not whats being tested here, just find a library or tool which can perform the analysis and output data that you can wrap in an api.

=====================================================================================

1.Dependencies:
    - filetransfers library for file upload convenience (in case the task can be changed);
    - gocr tool used for image recognition
